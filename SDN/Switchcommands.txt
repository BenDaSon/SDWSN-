===========================================================================================
There are three modes:
base(no need need to type)
openflow
config

To enter a mode(base doesn't need to enter name in terminal):
Type the mode name. 

To exit a mode: 
exit

base mode:
config - Enter the “config” context.
openflow - Enter the “openflow” context.
debug - Enter the “debug” context.
show ports - Displays information about each ethernet port including state, VLAN membership 
and traffic statistics.
show status - Displays the current device status.
show version - Display the firmware version.
restart - Restarts the Zodiac FX.
help - Display a list of available commands

openflow mode: 
show status - Displays the OpenFlow status.
show flows - Displays a list of the currently installed flows.
show meters - Displays a list of the currently configured meters and associated meter bands.
enable - Enables the Openflow functionality. 
disable - Disables the OpenFlow functionality.
clear flows - Clears the flow tables.
exit - Return the context back to the base level.

config mode:
save - Saves the current configuration to non-volatile memory.
restart - Restarts the Zodiac FX. Any unsaved configurations will be lost.
show config - Display the current device configuration.
show vlans - Displays a list of the currently configured VLANs.
set name <name> - Sets the device name. Maximum of 16 characters, entries will be truncated.
set mac-address <mac address> - Sets the MAC address of the device. The MAC address 
assigned to the device is located on a label on the underside of the device.
set ip-address <ip address> - Sets the device IP address.
set netmask <netmask> - Set the device netmask.
set gateway <ip address> - Sets the default gateway of the device.
set of-controller <ip address> - Sets the IP address the OpenFlow controller.
set of-port <tcp port> - Sets the TCP port of the OpenFlow Controller.
set failstate <secure|safe> - Sets the failstate of the Zodiac FX. When set to ‘secure’, all traffic 
is blocked when contact with the controller is lost. When set to ‘safe’, existing flows will be 
processed until they time out. The default configuration is ‘secure’.
add vlan <vlan id> <vlan name> - Creates a new VLAN. Valid IDs are 1-4096 and names must 
be less than 16 characters.
delete vlan <vlan id> - Deletes an existing VLAN.
set vlan-type <type> - Set the VAN to either ‘openflow' or ‘native’
add vlan-port <vlan id> <port> - Assigns a ethernet port to the designated VLAN. A port can only 
be a member of one VLAN.
delete vlan-port <port> - Remove the named Ethernet port from a VLAN.
factory reset - Configures and saves the configuration back to the factory test configuration, see 
appendix A for details. Note: the MAC address is not reset and will remain at it’s current value and 
a restart is required to apply the changes.
set of-version <version(0|1|4)> - Sets the device to only connect to an controller using the 
OpenFlow version specified. A value of 0 disables this function and allows the device to negotiate 
the version.
set ethertype-filter <enable|disable> - Enable or disable Ethertype filter functionality. When 
enabled, Zodiac FX will ignore packets of a non-standard Ethertype.
exit - Return the context back to the base level.

NOTE: In order to see clients using NORTHBOUND SWITCH, you must set VLAN ID to be TAGGED(Trunked)! set vlan-tag <VlAN ID> tagged
