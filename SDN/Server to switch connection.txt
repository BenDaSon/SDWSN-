VMware ESXI networking:

1. Create a virtual switch
2. Add uplink virtual network interface card(vmnicx) to the desired virtual switch you plan to use
3. Create a port group(name it whatever it doesn't matter) and put the desired virtual switch ) 
4. This port group will be put in the Network adapter of the virtual machine.
